# ObservablesUnitTests1

I created this project to demonstrate two methods I use to unit test an API call from an intermediate service that connects to another service. 

See [/src/app/shared/services/intermediate.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/tomwhite007/ObservablesUnitTests1/blob/master/src/app/shared/services/intermediate.service.spec.ts)

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
